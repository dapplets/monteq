# MonteQ

MonteQ is a mobile app that allows you to pay any check in Montenegro by agreement

In Montenegro, the buyer receives a standard fiscal receipt before payment. This makes it possible to introduce a crypto-payment system right on top of the standard QR codes that are on every receipt. And this system will not require any additional integration on the merchant side. 

By tokenizing real-world identifiers, we bring any traditional socio-economic interaction to the blockchain.

Our solution:

An app that allows you to link a crypto wallet to a real-world handler, such as the IE number that appears on the receipt.  Using a QR scanner, the app recognizes the receipt and generates a transaction. Depending on the wish of the buyer and the agreement with the seller, it is possible to send types or pay for the entire check.

How MonteQ mobile app works

1. MonteQ reuses QR code printed on every receipt.
2. Based on the info from this QR it creates a Tx to pay in crypto.
3. No further hard-/software or other prerequisites needed.
4. No changes for merchant for cash checkout.
5. Merchant claims collected payments and tips thereafter.
